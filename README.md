# File-Content-Searcher
This simple batch script helps you quickly search through large folders by recursively scanning for a specified term. You can choose to search within filenames or file contents. It prompts for the target folder and search term, then the method of the search. Afterwards, it logs the matches into a folder on the desktop "Util".
